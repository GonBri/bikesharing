 With this information we were able to show real  data to the investors where the bike-sharing services have been successful.
 We were able to show them the busiest time of the day, the checkout times by Gender, the amount of trips by weekday per hour. We also shared the Top Starting and Ending Locations which will be very important to focus in Des Moine.
 At the end we were able to deliver a complete analysis in order for the investors to make their decision.
